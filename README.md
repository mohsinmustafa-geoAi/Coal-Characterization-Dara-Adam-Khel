 Coal Characterization and Energy Potential of Dara Adam Khel
Project Overview
This project is based on research conducted for the Bachelor of Science in Geology at the University of Peshawar (Session 2020-2024). The study evaluates the energy content and industrial viability of coal deposits in the Dara Adam Khel region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.
Research Methodology
• Fieldwork: Four representative samples were collected from various outcrops in the Hangu and Lockhart Formations.
• Laboratory Analysis: Calorific values were determined using a bomb calorimeter at the Centralized Resource Lab, University of Peshawar.
• Energy Calculation: The tool utilizes the formula Q=C×ΔT to interpret heat energy released during combustion.
Key Findings
• Coal Rank: Classified as sub-bituminous based on ASTM D388 and ISO 11760 standards.
• Energy Range: Calorific values range from 4,500 to 6,900 kcal/kg.
• Environmental Profile: The coal is "emission-friendly" due to a low sulfur content (~1.2%) and moderate ash levels (12–18%).
• Industrial Suitability: While ideal for local power generation, its moderate ash content makes it less suitable than imported Iranian bituminous coal for specialized coke production in Pak Steel Mills.
