 Study Area: Dara Adam Khel, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Pakistan.
• Geological Context: Focused on the Hangu Formation (Early Paleocene) and Lockhart Formation (Middle Paleocene).
• Industrial Application: The tool identifies that while this coal is sub-bituminous and excellent for local power generation, its moderate ash (12–18%) makes it less suitable for specialized steel production compared to imported Iranian bituminous coal.
• Supervision: Note that the data was analyzed under the supervision of Dr. Muhammad Irfan Faiz at the University of Peshawar.
